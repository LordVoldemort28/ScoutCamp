WHAT CAREER PATH WILL YOU CHOOSE? 
------------------------------------

In this next activity, you are tasked to create a website about your future career path in programming. 

1.	Choose one of the four programming careers you would like to be from this handout.
2.	Open up the ‘websiteProject’ folder. 
3.	Open up the ‘atom’ IDE. This is where we will program our website!
4.	Go to File > Add Project Folder > and locate the websiteProject folder. Click on the websiteProject folder to make sure it is the project selected. Press OK.
5.	You will start with the ‘myWebsite.html’ and follow the instructions that have the comment  ‘<!--# instructions here  #--> ‘ 

__Notes:__
* You can have comments in your website files to help fellow programmers follow your code that won’t be read by the computer. Here are the different comment symbols you’ll find throughout this activity.
* Html files: ‘<!-- -->’
* CSS files: /* */
* JS files: // 

__TO SEE THE UPDATES YOU MAKE ON YOUR WEBSITE:__

1.	Double click on the ‘file explorer’. Navigate to the ‘websiteProject’ folder.
2.	Right click on myWebsite.html
3.	Click ‘open with’ and select Google Chrome.
4.	Every time you make an update, refresh the page using the   button.

__TASK 2: Styling your Website__

We will learn how to change colors of our website. 

1.	Open the styles.css file in ‘myWebsiteStyle’ folder.
2.	Scroll down until you find ‘Commons For Page Design’ section. 
3.	Locate the ‘.font-yellow’. This function makes some texts of the websites a certain yellow color. The combination of letters and numbers you see after the color with the # is called hex code which is how the computer reads color. #FFA600 is the code for a type of yellow. Let’s change it to ‘#ffff00’.
4.	Refresh your page and scroll down until you see the color change.
5.	Now go back to the myWebsite.html file.
6.	Scroll through until you find ‘font-yellow’. You can ‘ctrl+f’ to easier locate them. There should be 11 of them. Styles are only applied to a website if it’s coded in the .html file after the ‘class=’. 
7.	Go back to the styles.css and back to the ‘font-yellow’
8.	You can either return it back to the original color of #FFA600 or choose your own color.
9.	You can generate a hex code using [https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp]()
10.	Make sure to take the code that has a ‘#’ before it. 
11.	You can change the name of the function ‘.font-yellow’ to a more appropriate color if you change the color; BUT if you change the name in the stylesheet, you’ll have to go back to the myWebsite.html file and replace every ‘font-yellow’ with the new name you have in the stylesheet. 
12.	Congrats! You’ve learned how to change font color! 
13.	You can do much more with style, but let’s wait until we get through all the other tasks!
14.	Go back to myWebsite.html where you left off.
